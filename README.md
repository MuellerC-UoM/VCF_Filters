# VCF_Filters

#Once the VCF file has been made, filters have to be applied to excludes individuals and sites that don't meet the necessary criteria for further steps.

#We start with filteres that exclude sites and individuals with too low quality reads. These quality filters are required for almost all further analyses and can therefore be applied as default for anything that does not specifically require them to be skipped. Use Quality_Filter_Flowchart to see an example how the inidividual steps will change the vcf-file.
